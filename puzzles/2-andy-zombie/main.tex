% \begin{challenge}
{The insatiable Carli Ivor eats anything in her path. Last year at Count Calcula's party she ate ALL of the Counts famous meat pie! She started by eating half of the pie. Then she ate half of the remaining pie. She continued to have more servings, each time eating half of the remaining pie. A picture of what she ate last year is given below.

This year, the Count gave Carli some stipulations to the amount she could eat. If she eats more than her allotment she will not be invited to anymore parties! Carli is terrified she will not be able to eat anymore of the delicious meat pie, so she sent along a request.}

   {..*growl*...*moaning*.."Ahem, sorry, something was caught in my throat. It must have been who, I mean what, I ate earlier. Count Calcula gave me some odd rules to eat by and I need help understanding them! At first, I am allowed to eat one fourth of the entire meat pie! The Count then said if I was still hungry, I could eat a fourth of the portion that I just ate! Then if I was STILL hungry I could eat a fourth of the most recent portion! He said I could continue in this manner until I was full. }

    {Well, since I will not get full this poses a problem. Just tell me the most I am allowed to eat in order to satisfy the Counts restrictions!}

 {Carli Ivor has a puzzle piece if you can answer her question.}
