\phWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle 2}

After quickly gobbling up her third of the pie, Zom Bea realized that Count
Calcula hadn't counted on her eating all her servings at once!

``Very well!'' said the Count. ``I see that you will never be satisfied.
So, I will continue to bake you my meat pies. In 2017, I will bake you
\(1/17\) of a pie. In 2018, I will bake you \(1/18\) of a pie. And so on!
Are you happy now?''

Zom's not sure, exactly. Since zombies and vampires never die, \textbf{how many
total meat pies can Zom count on enjoying over the years to come?}
