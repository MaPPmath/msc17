 {Carli was pleased with your previous answer, but Count Calcula is devious, and may yet stop Carli Ivor from eating his pies.}

       % {The Count was pleased with how much I ate at his party, but he came up with a new test for me. The Count said I could eat a fifth of the next pie he makes, and in further servings I could have a fifth of my previous portion. I did some calculations and determined I could eat at most one fourth of the pie. If this trend continues, I must know the most that I can eat if he makes me eat in this same pattern again, but starting with an amount equal to one divided by some integer greater than one. We have already found the answer for a few of the first possibilities. Please help!}

% \begin{challengeOverview}

Carli Ivor's calculations are as follows
$s_1=\frac{1}{5}=.2$\\
$s_2=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5^2}=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{25}=.2+.04=.24$\\
$s_3=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5^2}+\frac{1}{5^3}=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{125}=.2+.04+.008=.248$\\

She did a few more calculations and realized that the answer was becoming close to $.25$ and she concluded that if she continued forever, that one fourth was the most she would be able to eat (which is correct!).
