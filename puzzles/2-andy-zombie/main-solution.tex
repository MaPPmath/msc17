\phWorksheet{Solution - Main Puzzle 2}

The answer is \(1/3\). Here's a handy image which explains why: each gray
triangle represents \(1/4\) of the previous serving, and each row
contains \(1/3\) gray triangles.

This image also works (as do many others); simliar to the above triangle,
each gray square represents \(1/4\) of the previous serving, and each
L-shape contains \(1/3\) gray squares.
