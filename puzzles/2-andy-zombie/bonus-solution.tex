\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 2}

The Count is offering up what mathematicians call a
``harmonic series'' of meat pies:

\[
  \sum_{i=17}^\infty \frac{1}{i}
=
  \frac{1}{17}+\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{19}+\dots
\]

Actually, unlike in the Main Puzzle,
this infinte sum is just that: infinite! Here's a nice way to see that
this sum cannot be finite.

\[
  \begin{array}{rl}
  \sum_{i=17}^\infty \frac{1}{i} &
  =
  (\frac{1}{17}+\dots+\frac{1}{32})+(\frac{1}{33}+\dots+\frac{1}{64})+\dots
  \\ &
  \geq
  (\frac{1}{32}+\dots+\frac{1}{32})+(\frac{1}{64}+\dots+\frac{1}{64})+\dots
  \\ &
  =
  \frac{16}{32}+\frac{32}{64}+\dots
  \\ &
  =
  \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\dots
  \\ &
  =
  \infty
\end{array}
\]

So, it might take a while, but Zom has at least \(100\) pies ahead of her
to enjoy.
