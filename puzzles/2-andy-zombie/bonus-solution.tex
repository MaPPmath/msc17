\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 2}



% \begin{exChallengeSol}
This is a well known series called a geometric series. If $| r | < 1$, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ar^{n-1}=\frac{a}{1-r}$. In particular, if $a=\frac{1}{x}$ and $r=\frac{1}{x}$, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} ar^{n-1}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{x})(\frac{1}{x})^{n-1}=\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{1-\frac{1}{x}}=\frac{1}{x-1}$.

We expect students to plug in the first few terms of several different series, and take an educated guess for the solution. Try x=6,7,and 8!
