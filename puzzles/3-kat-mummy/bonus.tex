Thanks to your help, Marvin's got the coolest super belt in town!\\

\textbf{"Thanks so much, Amp'd Squad! Count Calcula doesn't stand a chance against me in the costume contest now! I was thinking though.. it might be nice if my belt also had a symbol to represent invisibility! Can y'all find a way to make me a new belt with invisibility added to it?? I'd be so grateful and would definitely reward you with another puzzle piece!"}\\

Can you make Marvin a new belt on your inner tube with lines connecting each of the six symbols to all of the other symbols in such a way that no two lines cross? If you can figure out how to help Marvin with this, there is NO WAY Count Calcula can defeat him in the costume contest!
