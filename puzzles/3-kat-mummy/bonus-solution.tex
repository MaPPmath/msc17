\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 3}

This problem is equivalent to asking one to embed a complete graph on 6 vertices ($K_6$) on the torus (or donut). A solution can also be drawn on a two-dimensional representation of the torus. Since each of the corners represents the same point, a convenient way to draw the solution is to place one of the super powers (invisibility) on the corners. One such solution is included below.
