\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 6}

\(5AD1_{hex}\) is the solution. Again, rather than computing each number out
to base-10 and dividing by fifteen, there's a useful trick which may be
used instead:

\[
  \begin{array}{rcccccccc}
  5AD1 & = & 5_{hex}\times1000_{hex} &+& A_{hex}\times100_{hex} &+& D_{hex}\times10_{hex} &+& 1_{hex}\times1_{hex} \\
       & = & 5_{hex}\times FFF_{hex}+5_{hex} &+& A\times FF_{hex}+A_{hex} &+& D_{hex}\times F_{hex}+D_{hex} &+& 1_{hex}
  \end{array}
\]

Since \(FFF_{hex},FF_{hex},F_{hex}\) are easily seen to be divisible by
\(15=F_{hex}\), you need only check that
\(5_{hex}+A_{hex}+D_{hex}+1_{hex}=5+10+14+1=30\)
is divisble by \(15=F_{hex}\).
