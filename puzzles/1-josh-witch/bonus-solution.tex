\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 1}

Any given cauldron is equally close to 6 brooms. We can connect the 6 brooms together to circumscribe a hexagon around the given cauldron. We can tile the plane with hexagons. The area of this hexagon is $18\sqrt{3}$, the surface area of this hexagon covered by the cauldron is $9\pi$. So the surface area of the floor which can be covered by hexagons is $\frac{9\pi}{12\sqrt{3}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.9069$.
