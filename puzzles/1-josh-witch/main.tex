\phChapterWorksheet{Which Witch?}{Main Puzzle 1}

Grendel the Witch is cooking up a storm! She is brewing potions in several cauldrons.

Grendel needs to make at least three potions at a time, so she needs to use at least 3 cauldrons at once. If the cauldrons have a radius of 3 feet and Grendel must be equally close to all cauldrons used, what is the shortest distance Grendel can be from the center of a cauldron?

There is a special triangle which might help you answer this puzzle: the 30-60-90 triangle. Let x be the side opposite of the $60^\circ$ angle. Let y be the side opposite the $90^\circ$ angle. It must be that $y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}x$.
