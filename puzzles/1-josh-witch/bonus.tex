Grendel decided she's working too hard so she got her brooms to do the work for her. Grendel set up several brooms and cauldrons in her basement. Every broom is equally close to 3 cauldrons and is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ feet away from them. What is the maximum number of brooms a single cauldron can be $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$ feet away from? What shape do all the brooms surrounding one cauldron form?
