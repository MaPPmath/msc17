\phWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle 1}

Grendel decided she's working too hard so she got her brooms to do the work for her. Grendel set up several brooms and cauldrons in her basement which is infinitely large. Every broom is equally close to 3 cauldrons and is $2{\sqrt{3}}$ feet away from them. How much surface area of the floor can the cauldrons cover in this way?
