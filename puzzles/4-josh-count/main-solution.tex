\phWorksheet{Solution - Main Puzzle 4}

This problem is equivalent to the finding degree-sum formula in graph theory.

Rather than counting how many roads go into each building, and calculating
each buliding's cost, it's much easier to simply count the total number of
roads. Then, since each road leads into two buildings, we may multiply this
number by two to calculate the total number of roads entering all buildings.

In particular, Batty Bourough has \(17\) roads, and therefore \(34\) road-ends.
Since each building costs \(100\) teeth for each road end leading to it,
the total cost to renovate Batty Bourough is \(3400\) teeth.

As for Transylvania, we can ignore the total number of buildings, and use
the same process: \(73\) roads multiplied by \(2\)
equals \(146\) road-ends, making
the total cost to renovate Transylvania \(146\times 50=7300\) teeth.
