\phWorksheet{Solution - Main Puzzle 4}

This problem is essentially the degree-sum formula for graph theory. The degree of a building is the number of roads which lead to it. Adding up the degrees of every building will actually count the number of road twice. Why? Every road leads to exactly two buildings, meaning every road contributes exactly 2 to the sum of degrees.

With this in mind we see Plan A has 17 roads, so the sum of degrees of every building is 34 meaning it will cost 3400 dragon teeth to construct Plan A.

Plan B has 9 roads, so 18 is the sum of degrees meaning it will cost 1800 dragon teeth.

Plan C has 75 roads, so 150 is the degree-sum meaning it will cost 15,000 dragon teeth.
