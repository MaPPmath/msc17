Actually, the Count's ulimate goal is to renovate all of Transylvania itself,
a monsterous metropolis with \textbf{57 buildings} and \textbf{73 roads}.
He calculates that renovating each building would only cost
\textbf{50 dragon teeth}
per road leading into it, but he cannot seem to track down a roadmap
similar to his plan for Batty Borough. All he knows is that each road
begins and ends at a building.
\textbf{Does the
Count have enough information to calculuate the cost of renovating
Transylvania? If so, what would the renovation cost?}
