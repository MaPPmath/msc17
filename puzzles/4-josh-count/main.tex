\phChapterWorksheet{Count on It}{Main Puzzle 4}

Count Calcula is planning construction for a new town called
``Batty Bourough'' outside Transylvania. As
everyone knows, the cost to construct a building is
\textbf{100 dragon teeth} per
road leading into that building. ``Ack! Vat a pain in the neck!
I vish someone vould help me by \textit{biting}, er, writing down
the cost of my building plan!''

\noindent\textbf{What would be the total cost of building Batty Bourough?}

\vspace{3em}

Actually, the Count's ulimate goal is to renovate all of Transylvania itself,
a monsterous metropolis with \textbf{57 buildings} and \textbf{73 roads}.
He calculates that renovating each building would only cost
\textbf{50 dragon teeth}
per road leading into it, but he cannot seem to track down a roadmap
similar to his plan for Batty Borough. All he knows is that each road
begins and ends at a building.
\textbf{Does the
Count have enough information to calculuate the cost of renovating
Transylvania? If so, what would the renovation cost?}
