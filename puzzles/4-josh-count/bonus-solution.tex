\phWorksheet{Solution - Bonus Puzzle 4}

The pattern is called \textbf{Euler's formula}: for any such map where roads
cannot cross, \(B-R+P=2\), where \(B\) is the number of buildings,
\(R\) is the number of roads, and \(P\) is the number of parks.

You can see this in Batty Borough, where \(11-17+8=2\).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.3in,y=0.2in]
\phDrawBattyBorough{}
\node at (-5,-1) {\large\bf 1};
\node at (-6,3) {\large\bf 2};
\node at (-3,3) {\large\bf 3};
\node at (0,4) {\large\bf 4};
\node at (3,3) {\large\bf 5};
\node at (6,3) {\large\bf 6};
\node at (5,-1) {\large\bf 7};
\node at (0,-4) {\large\bf 8};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

So, in Transylvania, \(57-73+P=2\) solves to \(P=18\).
