\phWorksheet{Solution - Main Puzzle 5}

% Hints
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[*] Think about what cards Flo could have chosen that would allow for either Vi or Ru to know what the card is right away.
% \item[*] Think about suits instead of individual cards.
%
% \end{itemize}

% Solution
%
% Flo's card could be any of the Cats or Pumpkins! Let's see how to get there.
%
% Vi's comment lets us know that Vi (who was told the suit) does not know what the card is just based off of the suit alone (this makes sense since all four suits have more than two cards) and also that she knows Ru does not know the card either. This tells us that the suit cannot be Bats or Candy Corn.
%
% We know this is true since if Vi had been told the suit were Candy Corn, then it is possible that the 3 of Candy Corn was the card Flo chose. Since there is only one 3, that means that Ru would have been given 3 as the rank and would, therefore, know which card Flo had chosen. Since Vi is claiming that this situation can't happen, we know the suit cannot be Candy Corn. A similar argument works for Bats since there is only one 6 in the set of cards.\\

The only way Blinky already knew the chosen card is if it was the only card
of its rank on the table. The only two such cards are the 3 of Candy Corn
and the 6 of Bats.

However, since Myrtle knows that Blinky cannot know the chosen card,
she must know that the 3 of Candy Corn and the 6 of Bats were not chosen.
Since all she knows is the suit, she must have been told by Capser that
the suit is either Pumpkins or Black Cats.

Therefore, Goolia can rule out all the Candy Corn and Bats cards.
