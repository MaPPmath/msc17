\phChapterWorksheet{Mummy Madness}{Main Puzzle 5}

Goolia the Ghost was wondering around the Wayward Tavern yesterday when
she saw three witches, Flo, Vi, and Ru, seated around a cauldron with the
following cards:

Flo told the other witches that she was going to select one card and give it
special powers. She told Vi the suit (Bats, Black Cats, Pumpkins, or Candy
Corn) and told Ru the rank (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Goolia then heard Vi make
the following comment:

Vi: Double double toil and trouble! I don’t know what card Flo picked, but I
know that Ru doesn’t know either!

The witches aren’t the only ones interested in knowing what card Flo se-
lected though..

”Amp’d Squad! I may be a ghost, but I want to know *witch*
card has special powers! I know that what Vi said narrows down the
possibilities, but I can’t quite figure out how! If you can help me
figure it out, I’ll reward you with a puzzle piece!”

Follow the logic of the witches’ conversation to determine the remaining
possibilities of Flo’s card.
