Goolia the Ghost was floating around the Wayward Tavern yesterday when she
saw three friends, Casper, Myrtle, and Blinky, seated around a table with the
following cards:

\end{center}

She then witnessed the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Casper told his friends:
        ``\textit{One of these cards is my favorite. I'll tell Casper
        its suit, and then I'll tell Blinky its rank.}''
  \item Casper secretly told Myrtle the suit:
        Bats, Black Cats, Pumpkins, or Candy Corn.
  \item Casper secretly told Blinky the rank:
        A, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  \item Myrtle mentioned offhand:
        ``\textit{Ooooohhh! I don't know what card Casper picked, but I know
        that Blinky doesn't know either!}''
\end{itemize}

Goolia immediately thought to herself,
``\textit{Well, that rules out a few of them, anyway!}''
\textbf{Which of the cards was Goolia able to rule out, given what
she saw and heard from the three card-playing ghosts?}
