\phWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle 5}

Now that Goolia knows which suits Flo’s card could be, she listens to more
of their conversation!
Ru: Muahaha!! Fire burn, and cauldron bubble! I didn’t know what card Flo
picked, but after listening to what Vi has to say, I have figured it out!
Vi: Fair is foul and foul is fair! In that case, I now know too!
”Amp’d Squad! I am so close to knowing which card has special
powers!! With your help, I know we can figure out which card Flo
chose! I’ll gladly provide a puzzle piece for your troubles!”
With the clues Goolia overheard, can you help her figure out which card has
the special powers??
