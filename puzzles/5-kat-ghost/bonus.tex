\begin{itemize}
  \item Casper told his friends:
        ``\textit{One of these cards is my favorite. I'll tell Casper
        its suit, and then I'll tell Blinky its rank.}''
  \item Casper secretly told Myrtle the suit:
        Bats, Black Cats, Pumpkins, or Candy Corn.
  \item Casper secretly told Blinky the rank:
        Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  \item Myrtle shrieked:
        ``\textit{Ooooohhh! I don't know what card Casper picked, but I know
        that Blinky doesn't know either!}''
  \item Blinky moaned:
        ``\textit{Ahhhhh! You are right, but now that you've said that,
        I just figured it out!}''
  \item Myrtle wailed:
        ``\textit{Aiiieee! And now I know as well!}''
