\phSection{Team Guides}

Each team is assigned a Guide from our pool of volunteers. They can't solve
the puzzles for you, but they may have some helpful words of advice nonetheless.

\phSection{Puzzles}

Your day begins with a warm-up \textbf{Opening Puzzle} to get your mind running
and heart racing! Try to solve this challenge as quickly as possible.

Once you've finished the opener, your team can begin working on the first of two
\textbf{Puzzle Phases}. Each Phase contains three \textbf{Main Puzzles}.
If you can demonstrate the correct solution for a Main Puzzle
to the \textbf{Judge} located
at \textbf{Game Control}, you'll be given a \textbf{Bonus Puzzle}.
Bonus Puzzle solutions should be submitted to your Guide by the end of
the phase.

We'll wrap up the day with a \textbf{Just for Fun Puzzle} while the scores
are tabulated. It's, ah, just for fun!

\phSection{Winning the Game}

Teams will be scored based on how many Main Puzzles they solved.
If multiple teams are tied for Main Puzzles solved, then that tie will be broken
by the number of Bonus Puzzles solved. Finally, if multiple teams are tied
for both Main Puzzles and Bonus Puzzles solved, the team that completed the
Opening Puzzle fastest will be the winner.
